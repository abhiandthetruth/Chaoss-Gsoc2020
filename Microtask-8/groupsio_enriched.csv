what are new contributors contributing to?

"Basically the options are:


  1.  Moderate every new subscriber
  2.  Moderate the first message
  3.  Moderate the first X messages

There's no ""click to confirm"" option. Yes, I thought that was weird, too. It is what it is. FWIW, there's also no option to disable all moderation. Moderation of some sort is required for spam prevention reasons.

I chose to go for #2 because it allows people to subscribe and receive messages more or less immediately, even if all they want to do is simply follow along and lurk for a while. When they're ready to participate, then they can jump through the moderation hoop.

Right now the list is set so anyone can subscribe but their first message is moderated (and open after that).

In Carlo's case, he subscribed with his Gmail account, but sent the message with his Juniper account. I was able to moderate the message through as a one-off but because it wasn't sent from the address with which he subscribed he'll still need to have that first moderation on his subscribed address.

So it worked because I made it work, in his case. For others it's working as planned. :-)

That's unlikely to happen. Some people might join but given there's a
lack of clear direction even with the limited number of participants
now, it's not going to improve with more participants.

Developers are not attracted to slideware. That has never worked before

It should be said that many projects are announced with no existing code.

Zabiplane MVP scope isn't really finalized yet, and that MVP seems way bigger than any other dataplane that exists, needs to reduce down to have a focus, code then be against an agreed structure, functionality, and architecture that reflects Zabiplane roadmap.

Code should be of least concern at this stage, we do not even have agreement on anything yet.

First, please know that I have canceled today’s use case WG as our agenda for today was to review last weeks inputs to the Principles document, which we will do tomorrow on Carlo’s R&D WG call.

I also wanted to know if it makes sense at this point to combine the the R&D and Use-Case calls. My reason for proposing this is that the Use-Case Doc is pending on inputs from the R&D WG, and we can use the combined team call to hopefully get more active participation to address the pending actions.  

What are your thoughts?  Please respond with Yay/Nay, and thanks!

Best,
Gary

I have unfortunately been double booked for tomorrow morning, and can't cancel or move the other meeting around. We also still are a couple people short, so I don't expect to report much progress, unfortunately.

Unless there are topics to discuss and someone volunteers to run the meeting without me, I'll be canceling for this week.

"Within the DPDK marketing committee we’ve been looking at taking one of our DPDK events and turning it into a broader open source data plane event. The aim is to get developers from multiple data plane projects together to share information, exchange ideas, and improve collaboration between projects. Projects that we’re discussing this with include: DPDK, FD.io, OVS, Tungsten Fabric, FRR and others.

We initially looked at the possibility of colocating with ONES, but time is too tight so that’s not realistic. We’re now looking at our DPDK Userspace event (our annual community event), which is being planned for Bordeaux some time in September.

To proceed with plans for a data plane event we need to know which other projects are interested. The Linux Foundation have polled other projects to determine their level of interest via the email included below. I heard yesterday that the distribution for this may not have included all the relevant people from the Zabiplane community. To make sure we hit everybody, I’m posting this to the Zabiplane dev mailing list.

Is there interest from Zabiplane in joining a data plane event? See Trishan’s email below for details on the expected cost. If there is interest, or if people have questions, please contact either me or Trishan. If it makes sense to schedule a call to discuss this in more detail, then we can do that.

My apologies for having to cancel this call at the last minute- My conference bridge is being used for another all day workshop that I am hosting, and it required my web conference bridge so it is unavailable for this call.  We are also not getting adequate inputs to the Use-Case WG document for a productive agenda anyways.
